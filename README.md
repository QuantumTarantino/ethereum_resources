# Ethereum resources

## Getting Started

In this repository you will find the main resources with which you can learn and improve your skills on DAPPs development for Ethereum network. I do not try to make an extensive repository, my idea is condense resources into the best ones to improve and make you a good developer. I will be updating periodically as soon as I find a good resource to add here.
Feel free to send [pull requests](https://github.com/QuantumTarantino/ethereum_dev_resources). Any suggestions will be evaluated to improve the quality of this repository.

## Tutorials

* [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) - A complete website tutorial (powered by Loom Network) who can teach you everything you need to develope Ethereum Dapps (e.g., contract development as well as the interaction with them through the front end).

* [Petshop](https://trufflesuite.com/tutorial/) - One of the best tutorials to start Dapp developing, it covers Smart contract development and Front end integration using the truffle framework by a construction of a pet adoption store. Also teachs you to get an easy interaction with DAPPs by using Metamask.

* [Greeter](https://www.ethereum.org/greeter) - Write your first contract with this tutorial powered by the Ethereum Foundation.

* [DappUniversity](http://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial) - Build a full Ethereum Dapp. Powered by Gregory from DappUniversity.

## IDEs and tools

* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) - Browser-Only IDE for Smart Contracts development. Remix allows you write fast smart contracts and make tests allowing you to deploy on any network smart contracts straight from the interface.

* [Ganacle CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) - Build a personal Ethereum blockchain to run tests. Powered by Consensys.

* [Ganache GUI](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) - Same as Ganache CLI. GUI version. Powered by Consensys.

## Plugins and libraries

* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - This plugin makes a bridge between your Ethereum account and your browser to interact with Dapps, contracts or simply make transaction with other accounts.

* [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) - You can do lot of things with this npm package tool like compile your contracts, migrate it to any network and test it. Powered by Consensys.

* [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) - This library lets you interact from your Javascript code, with the Ethereum network (e.g., make transactions with a contract).

* [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Same as web3.js but for Python.

## Explorers

* [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - This block explorer is widely used by the community. It allows you to see any type of movement in the main network as well as in the most used testnets of Ethereum. Powered by ethereum.

* [Etherchain](https://www.etherchain.org/) - Other block explorer.

* [Ethviewer](http://ethviewer.live/) - You can see everything happening on Ethereum mainnet at real time. It's useful to learn how Ethereum blockchain works.

* [Rinkeby BE](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats) - You can visualizate Rinkeby testnet on real time. So cool!

## Security resources

* [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity) - OpenZeppelin make standards for most common contracts like: tokens, ownership or math operations.

* [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions/) - Ethereum smart contracts hacking game powered by OpenZeppelin. Useful to learn security for contracts.

* [CaptureTheEther](https://capturetheether.com/) - Another CTF game powered by SMARX.

## Other githubs
